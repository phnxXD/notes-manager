# Note Taker
This is a simple GUI application built using the PySimpleGUI library in Python. The app allows users to take notes, save them to a file, and search for existing notes.

## Requirements
To run this application, you'll need Python 3 and the PySimpleGUI library installed on your machine. You can install PySimpleGUI using pip:


* `pip install PySimpleGUI`

## Usage
To use the application, simply run the notetaker.py script in your terminal:

* `python notetaker.py`

When you run the script, a window will appear with two input fields: "Name" and "Note". To save a note, enter a name and some text in the input fields, and click the "Save" button. The note will be saved to a file called notes.txt.

To search for existing notes, enter a search term in the "Search" field, and click the "Search" button. The application will search through all saved notes for any that contain the search term, and display them in a list below the search field.

To exit the application, click the "Exit" button or close the window.
